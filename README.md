OMG, I just finished watching Hurry Up Tomorrow and I legit donâ€™t know what the heck I just saw. ðŸ˜‚ Like, I was expecting something kinda epic but it ended up being this total rollercoaster of chaos. Seriously, the whole plot was a hot mess, like they were writing it five minutes before shooting. But in a good way? You know what I mean? Somehow it just works, even if it's bonkers. Like, you think one thing's gonna happen and then BAM! Total curveball. 

Honestly, though, that lead actor? I'm torn between thinking they were amazing or completely out of their depth. Just so much yelling, lmao. But then there were these moments where I was like woah, where did that come from? I donâ€™t know, maybe the director was just letting them do whatever and hoping for the best. And that soundtrack? Catchy but kinda all over the place. Gonna be humming it for days whether I want to or not. ðŸ˜…

> To be fair, I ended up having to download the movie 'cause every streaming service I have failed me. Worth it, though, even if I'm pretty sure I lost a few brain cells. It'll probably be one of those flicks where six months from now Iâ€™ll randomly think about it and still not be sure if I actually saw it, or if it was some fever dream.

Oh, also, that twist at the end? Did you see that coming at all? Like, wtf, I was legit blindsided. Though, in hindsight, maybe it was kinda obvious, but who even has time to play detective when you're busy just trying to keep up with all the madness. ðŸ˜‚ Anyway, grab your popcorn before even thinking of pressing play, it's a ride.

Random side note, but my cat totally freaked out during one of the louder scenes, like full-on puffed tail and all. Poor guy looked at me like I betrayed him. Guess thatâ€™s what I get for trying to watch the movie at full volume. ðŸ˜‚

string randomLine = Doesn't even make sense;

Okay, I should probably crash now before I hear that theme music in my dreams. Hit me up if you wanna discuss more crazy plot theories or something, haha. Catch you later!
